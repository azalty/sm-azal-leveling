# sm-azal-leveling
A complete leveling and inventory system. Mainly developed for TheWalkingTeam community.

:warning: This plugin isn't currently in a recommended state. It can be ran, but it's not really adapted to the general public right now. :warning:

## Overview
This plugin is currently in a semi-private state. It hasn't really be worked on to make it public, and little to no explanation is available.

This will change in some time as I work little by little to make the plugin useable on any server.\
The main changes will be that most dependencies will become optional (Zephyrus Store, MyJailshop, Prometheus (the dependency is currently a private version)).

## Anything else?
Yes. The development of the plugin will stay focused on TheWalkingTeam community, and so everything custom that will be added or included will stay, even if not used publicly, but those changes will be made optional for other communities.

My goal is to make this plugin work for other servers.

## Why did you make this plugin public?
I want to share my knowledge and my work on SourcePawn, even though it could be used by 'competitors', but I don't really like this word as I'm not really a business, don't make profits and only do what I do because I like it.

English, French, and other languages are welcome to use my plugin.

**However, if you own a French jailbreak/ba_jail server, please have different rules and plugins. Dividing communities is not useful, but appealing to different ones is.**

**Please, do not block the `sm plugins` command (to show the list of plugins). I won't help you if you do that as it's a dickhead move.**

## What do you plan to do?
- Add a complete documentation/wiki with instructions to configure the plugin and all of its features
- Make dependencies optional and not cause errors or problems with the plugin if not run
- Add translation support

## Do you accept contributions?
Yes, I accept the reporting of issues/bugs/whatever, and I accept Pull Requests if they fix a bug or improve the code in a slight way.\
Restructuring will likely harm my efficiency, please contact me before proposing any big changes.

If you want to add a feature, please contact me. I'll likely refuse if I don't want this feature in my server, but might still accept it if it's optional.

## What about your other plugins?
To preserve some originality and due to the fact most of my plugins are in a linked and closed ecosystem, most of my other private plugins won't be published until my community dies. After that, I guess you'll be free to run my server as I'll publish my entire config and plugin pool.

A big reason is also security. Open code can be easily broken by SQL Injections or with some precise timings if a developer sees a exploit in the code.\
I protect my plugins from this sort of things, but there are often unplanned attack vectors or oversights.\
For this reason, if you find an exploit in this plugin, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE report it to me (privately if really sensitive), and don't exploit it.

## Thanks
Thanks to:
- everyone who helped me with my code or my life :heart:
- asherkin (who answered my specific questions about SourcePawn)
- shanapu (for making great plugins that my jail server uses, and which inspired me to make my own server)

Don't be evil :sparkles:

## **:heart: LONG LIVE OPEN SOURCE, FREE PROJECTS :heart:**
